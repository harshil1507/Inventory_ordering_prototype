# Inventory_ordering_prototype
This is a small scale prototype model for ordering inventory.
It has a GUI made with the help of Swing. 
The items that are stored in the shop are listed in a database and the GUI enables the shopkeeper/manager to select the item that is to be ordered from a drop down list. A text box has been provided to enter the quantity of the selected item and the last column gives the cost of the selected item (item price * quantity). In this prototype I have made a provision of ordering 5 items at a time. On pressing the place order button, the costs of all the items are added which gives the shopkeeper/manager the final cost of the order.
